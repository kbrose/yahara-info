    <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
    <p>
        In 1979 the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued several orders that together set the maximum and minimum levels of Lakes <a href="https://lwrd.countyofdane.com/documents/pdf/DNR-3-SD-77-808.pdf">Mendota</a>, <a href="https://lwrd.countyofdane.com/documents/pdf/DNR-3-SD-77-819.pdf">Monona</a>, <a href="https://lwrd.countyofdane.com/documents/pdf/DNR-3-SD-77-819.pdf">Waubesa</a>, and <a href="https://pdf.countyofdane.com/lwrd/landconservation/DNR-3-WR-1116.pdf">Kegonsa</a>.

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the lake levels have consistently been higher than required. From October 2007 through November 2018 Lake Mendota spent 1,323 of 3,946 days (i.e. 33.6%, about one third) above its maximum height. On the other hand, Mendota was below its minimum level for only 332 days (8.4%). The other lakes were similar – Monona was too high 44.2% of the time and too low 8.0% of the time, Waubesa was 39.6% too high vs. 7.4% too low, and Kegonsa 27.7% too high vs. 7.6% too low.

    <p>
        Dane County Parks controls the lake levels with several dams. Even if Dane County wanted to keep the lake levels compliant, Mendota's Summer requirements leave only six inches between minimum and maximum. In comparison, the rainfall in August 2018 caused Mendota to rise a full 16 inches. Getting a lake down to a compliant level is also not as simple as flipping a switch and letting the water out. Slow river flow and drainage makes reducing water levels a slow, and sometimes painful, process.
